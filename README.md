# loopback4-authentication-app

This LoopBack 4 application is based on https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/4223.

The objective of this repo is to try out what is the best way to break down the authentication tutorials: the one proposed in https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/4223 and https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Authentication-Tutorial.html.

- Basic authentication may not be an ideal method for authentication. So I'm investigating whether I can take part of the above PR as a stepping stone to add jwt authentication instead.

## Instructions

Set up the minimal infrastructure for authentication, read [instructions-auth-infrastructure.md](instructions-auth-infrastructure.md).
